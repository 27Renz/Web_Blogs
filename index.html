						<h2>Japanese Era</h2>
						<span>1942 to 1945</span>
						<p id="discription">During the period of Japanese occupation in the Philippines from 1942 to 1945, the landscape of economic governance underwent a profound transformation under the influence of the Imperial Japanese forces. The establishment of the Japanese-Sponsored Philippine Republic, led by President Jose P. Laurel, marked a significant chapter in Philippine history, characterized by altered administrative structures and the implementation of various economic policies, including taxation. This era witnessed the imposition of taxes and levies to finance the Japanese war efforts and facilitate the exploitation of local resources. The taxation policies during this period were part of a broader strategy aimed at consolidating control over the occupied territories and sustaining the logistical demands of the Japanese military machine. Exploring the intricacies of Japanese taxation in the Philippines during 1942-1945 provides insights into the economic dynamics and challenges faced by the Filipino population under foreign occupation, reflecting a pivotal chapter in the nation's history.</p>
